                <p class="mb-3 text-center">
                    Humans should get experienced how to deal with people and gain their respect. I liked to work, and found clubs, or organisation that teach people new concepts and open doors for a new world of opportunities and achievements that they couldn't get because of lack of knowledge or experience. So, I liked to share different societies that I have involved in.
